jar cmd madhe = "'xyz' is not recognized as an internal or external command," then how to resolve them 

for ex - you opened cmd --> minikube + enter = les say we get error : 'minikube' is not recognized as an internal or external command,  

SOLUTION :- 

step 1 -:
 
    go to location where minikube.exe files are located --> then copy file location --> go to environmental variables --> use variable for mohit :-
                                                                                                                                        - click on path 
                                                                                                                                        - enter variable name = PATH
                                                                                                                                        - variable value = path of minikube.exe 
                                                                                                                                        
 step 2 -: go to minikube.exe file location and check actual name of that file 
           ex - minikube_3.4.2                     minikube
                (actaul name of file)              ( we are typing minikube on cmd )
                change file name to 
                 minikube.exe
